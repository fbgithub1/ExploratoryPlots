# ExploratoryPlots
Coursera - Exploratory Data Analysis - week 1 assignment

See [https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1) for info, link to source data, and assignment instructions. Note that source data are not included in this repo - no sense in reproducing large files.

*process.R* is the script that produces *filtered.txt*, which is the minimal set of data that's required for this assignment. *process.R* operates on the huge, original data set, which is available at [this link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip).

I ignored the instructions to fork Roger Peng's repo, which I don't see as a necessary component of this assignment.
